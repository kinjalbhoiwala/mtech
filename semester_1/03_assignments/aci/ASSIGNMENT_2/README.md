This code is written in Prolog, a logic programming language. It defines a set of rules to determine the best water source for a community based on various location factors such as proximity to rivers, lakes, and beaches, rainfall intensity, and aquifer type.

Let's go through the code step by step:

The code starts by defining rules to determine the proximity to water sources. There are three rules: close_to_river, close_to_lake, and close_to_beach. Each rule prompts the user to enter the distance from the location to the nearest river, lake, or beach, respectively. The distance is read from the user using the read predicate. These rules also check if the distance is less than a certain threshold.

Next, the code defines rules to determine the rainfall intensity. There are three rules: low_rainfall, medium_rainfall, and high_rainfall. Similar to the previous rules, the user is prompted to enter the average monthly rainfall amount in millimeters. The rainfall amount is read from the user, and these rules check if the amount falls within specific ranges.

The code then defines a rule to determine the aquifer type. The sandy_aquifer rule prompts the user to answer whether the aquifer is sandy or not. The user's response is read using the read predicate, and the rule checks if the response is "yes".

Finally, the code defines rules to predict the best water source based on the decision tree. There are five rules: best_water_source(groundwater), best_water_source(lake), best_water_source(river) (twice), and best_water_source(rain). These rules use the previously defined rules to make predictions.

The best_water_source(groundwater) rule predicts groundwater as the best water source if the location is far from rivers and lakes, and not close to a beach.
The best_water_source(lake) rule predicts a lake as the best water source if the location is far from rivers but close to a lake.
The first best_water_source(river) rule predicts a river as the best water source if the location is close to a river and has low rainfall.
The second best_water_source(river) rule predicts a river as the best water source if the location is close to a river, has medium rainfall, and the aquifer is sandy.
The second best_water_source(rain) rule predicts rain as the best water source if the location is close to a river, has medium rainfall, and the aquifer is not sandy.
The last best_water_source(rain) rule predicts rain as the best water source if the location is far from rivers and lakes and has high rainfall.
Finally, the main rule is defined. It is the main goal that is called to predict the best water source based on the location factors. It first displays a message to indicate that it is predicting the best water source. Then, it calls the best_water_source rule with a variable WaterSource to store the predicted water source. Finally, it displays the predicted water source to the user.

To use this code, you would need to consult the file in a Prolog interpreter and then call the main rule to see the predicted water source based on the provided location factors.
