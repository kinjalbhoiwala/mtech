In 120 throws of a single die, the distribution of faces observed is given in the JSON: 

[
    {
        "Face": "1",
        "Frequency": "30"
    },
    {
        "Face": "2",
        "Frequency": "25"
    },
    {
        "Face": "3",
        "Frequency": "18"
    },
    {
        "Face": "4",
        "Frequency": "10"
    },
    {
        "Face": "5",
        "Frequency": "22"
    },
    {
        "Face": "6",
        "Frequency": "15"
    }
]

Taking a level of significance as 5%, please explain how can we determine if the dice is biased.

To determine if the die is biased, we need to perform a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. 
Since the chi-square test compares the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies under
the assumption that the die is fair (i.e., each face has an equal probability of 1/6).

Step 1. Define Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): The die is fair (not biased).
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The die is biased.



Step 2. Calculate Expected Frequencies:
Under the assumption of a fair die, each face should occur with a probability of 1/6 and we 
expect each face to appear 20 times in 120 throws.

∴ Each face has an equal probability of 1/6 and the total number of throws in this case is 120.

Eᵢ = Total throws/Number of faces
Eᵢ = 120/6 = 20



Step 3. Compute the Chi-Square Statistic:
For each face, calculate the squared difference between the observed and expected frequencies,
and then divide by the expected frequency. Sum up these values to get the chi-square statistic.

χ² = ∑ ((Oᵢ − Eᵢ)²/Eᵢ)

Where:
Oᵢ is the observed frequency for face 
Eᵢ is the expected frequency for face 

χ² = ((30−20)²/20) + ((25−20)²/20) + ((18−20)²/20) + ((10−20)²/20) + ((22−20)²/20) + ((15−20)²/20)
χ² = 12.9



Step 4. Degrees of Freedom (df): is equal to the number of categories (faces) minus 1
df = 6 - 1
df = 5



Step 5. Critical Value:
Determine the critical value from the chi-square distribution table for the chosen
level of significance (5% in this case) and the degrees of freedom.

From chi-square distribution table,
Critical-χ² = 11.0705



Step 6. Compare Statistic with Critical Value:
If the calculated chi-square statistic is greater than the critical value, null hypothesis is rejected.

For 120 throws of our dice, 
calculated-χ² (12.9) > Critical-χ² (11.0705); at a 5% level of significance with 5 degrees of freedom

Thus we reject the null hypothesis (H₀), concluding that there is evidence to conclude that the die is biased.
