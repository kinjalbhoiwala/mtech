A company has the head office at Chennai and a branch at Coimbatore. The personnel director wanted
to know if the workers at the two places would like the introduction of a new plan of work and a 
survey was conducted for this purpose. Out of a sample of 500 workers at Chennai, 62% favoured the
new plan. At Coimbatore out of a sample of 400 workers, 41% were against the new plan. Is there any
significant difference between the two groups in their attitude towards the new plan at 5% level?
Elaborate how to make the conclusion.

To determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups (i.e. Chennai and Coimbatore) in
their attitude towards the new plan, we need to perform hypothesis test for the difference in proportions. 
In this case, we are comparing the proportion of workers favoring the new plan in Chennai to the proportion
of workers favoring the new plan in Coimbatore.

p1: Proportion of workers in Chennai favoring the new plan.
p2: Proportion of workers in Coimbatore favoring the new plan.

Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the attitudes of the workers at Chennai and the workers at Coimbatore
H0: p1 = p2

Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference between the attitudes of the workers at Chennai and the workers at Coimbatore
H1: p1 ≠ p2

Using a z-test for comparing two proportions to test these hypotheses. The formula for the test statistic is:
p̂1: Sample proportion in Chennai 
∴ p̂1 = 0.62

p̂2: Sample proportion in Coimbatore
∴ p̂2 = 0.59

p: Pooled sample proportion p = (x1 +x2)/(n1​ + n2) = p̂

n1: Sample size of workers in Chennai 
=> n1 = 500
n2: Sample size of workers in Coimbatore 
n2 = 400

x1 = Number of workers in Chennai favoring the new plan
∴ x1 = 0.62×500
=> x1 = 310

x2 = Number of workers in Coimbatore favoring the new plan
∴ x2 = 0.59 × 400
x2 = 236

p = p̂ = (x1+x2)/(n1+n2) = (310 + 236)/(500 + 400) = 0.60667
SE = sqrt(p̂ * (1 - p̂) * ((1/n1) + (1/n2))) 
SE = sqrt(0.60667 * (1 - 0.60667) * ((1/400) + (1/500)))
SE = 0.03277

Calculating z-score
z = (p̂1 - p̂2)/SE = (0.62−0.59)/0.03277 = 0.91550


Compare the calculated z-value to the critical value of the standard normal distribution to make a decision.
Since this is a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level, we compare the absolute value of calculated z to
 1.96 (i.e. the critical z value).

Since, ∣0.91550∣<1.96
∴ Decision: fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0) 
=> Interpretation: There is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference in attitudes, towards the
new plan, between the workers in Chennai and Coimbatore, at the 5% significance level. Note that failing to
reject the null hypothesis does not imply the groups attitudes are exactly the same.
